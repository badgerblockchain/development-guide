# Final Block: Closing Thoughts


## Goal

+ Review what we did this semester.
+ What went well / what didn't go so well.
+ How to make technical meetings better in the future!


## What did we accomplish?

Spring of 2022 we made an on chain game we called [Badger Blocks](https://github.com/badgerblockchain/badger-blocks). You can see a skeleton where you can implement the guts and then check against our master branch. 

In early meetings we went over aspects of solidity and how it applied to what we wanted to accomplish, getting people to learn more about on chain code. 

Towards the end of the semester we dove into more complex topics surrounding solidity development. This included running through NFT code, specifically [MoonCats](https://opensea.io/collection/acclimatedmooncats) with a developer on that project, talking MEV with flashbots, talking about new industry developments such as [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626).


## What didn't go so well?

The initial idea was to go through solidity basics and then jump into people working on projects. There was a massive gap in experience which made it difficult to cater to everyone in the beginning. In reality, we can't do that. Moving forward I think people can do the basics themselves through resources like [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course).

This would free up more time for us to organize other aspects of our technical meetings. 

We also wanted to incorporate smaller groups of students to work on other projects. This would be awesome, and we have great starting blocks for the future. We packed in a lot of Badger Blockchain events into one semester and it was probably hard to make time for that, as well as school, and personal life. 


## What went well?

We touched on this, but every Sunday each person that attended technical meetings learned something new, including me! I had a lot of fun with the group that came out on Sundays. A lot of intelligent discussions happened here too.


## What can be done to make these better?

Taking some feedback from members, we don't necessarily need to focus on coding basics. We have plans to integrate some rust into our meetings next semester too!

A new approach we want to take will look more like meeting-independent coding examples and walkthroughs. This means that previous meetings won't be prerequisites if you miss one. We would like to integrate these with real world problems and faciliate discussion around how we can use what we learned in the real world.


### Overall

For our second semester after the club reboot we had a lot of great discussions, learned a lot, and had fun doing it too!
