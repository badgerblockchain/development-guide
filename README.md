# Badger Blockchain Development Curriculum
The guide for our dapp development curriculum. Resources and topics discussed at meetings will be contained within this repository. You can follow along with this bare bones framework of our dapp [Badger Blocks](https://github.com/badgerblockchain/badger-blocks).

## Outcomes
